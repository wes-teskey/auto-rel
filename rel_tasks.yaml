    are any part failures, including suggested debugs, otherwise write only

    The seminconductor test coducted is:

    {test_1} 
    
    and the failing part (if any) are:
    
    {test_1_failures}

    These parts are failing because of they have a higher Idss that the limit of:
    
    {Idss_lim}
    
    Be very accuracte and concise.

    Make sure to suggest debugs for any failing parts.

    Again, if there are no part failures, meaning that you are not provided any 
    five digit DIE ID and corresponding Idss, write ONLY "No part failures found."
