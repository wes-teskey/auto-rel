  description: >
    Write a 200 word summary for the reliability data from reliability testing. Combine
    all reports from the senior reliability engineers into an executive summary for the CEO.

    MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE ALL FAILING PARTS IN THE SUMMARY.

    Give feedback to the senior reliability engineers if their summary is not 
    accurate, concise, or has other errors.
    
    Be very accuracte and concise yourself.

    Make sure to suggest debugs for any failing parts.

    Here are the details of all failing parts that the senior reliability engineers should have
    included in their summaries:
